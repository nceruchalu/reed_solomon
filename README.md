## About RS Encoder/Decoder + Channel Simulation
#### Description Of Error Correcting Code
I implemented the t-error-correcting Reed-Solomon code of field size `2^m` and
length `n = 2^m -1`, where `m` and `t` are variable input parameters. Note that `k = n-2t`.
This arithmetic is implemented over fields of characteristic 2.


#### Encoder
* `alpha` is the root of primitive polynomial of order `m`
* First the generator polynomial for the RS code is formed by following the equation:
  
  ```  
  g(x) = (x - alpha)(x - alpha^2)...(x - alpha^2t)
  ```
  Because we are working with mod2, - and + are interchangeable, so:
  ```  
  g(x) = (x + alpha)(x + alpha^2)...(x + alpha^2t)
  ```

* Given a message vector `m = (m_0, m_1,... m_(k-1))` its corresponding message
polynomial is: 
  
  ```
  m(x) = m_0 + m_1*x + ... + m_(k-1)*x^(k-1)
  ```
  where each `m_i` is in a Galois Field with `2^m` elements, `GF(2^m)`.
  The systematic encoding process produces a codeword defined by:
  ```
  c(x) = m(x)*x^(n-k) + [m(x)*x^(n-k)]%g(x)
  ```


#### Decoder
Given a received vector `rc(x)` the algebraic decoding of the Reed-Solomon code
has the following steps:
* **Computation of the syndrome**
  The syndromes are:
  
  ```
  S_1 = rc(alpha)`;   S_2 = rc(a^2);   ...     ; S_2t = rc(a^2t)
  ```
  And the syndrome polynomial is:
  ```
  s(x) = S_1 + S_2*x + ... + S_2t*x^(2t-1)
  ```
  
* **Determination of the error locator polynomial using the Euclidean Algorithm** 
  This runs the extended euclidean algorithm with: 
  `a(x) = x^2t` and `b(x) = s(x)`, until `deg(r_i(x)) < t`.
  At this terminating value of `i`:
  * The error magnitude/value/evaluator polynomial: `omega(x) = r_i(x)/t_i(0)` 
  * The error locator polynomial: `lambda(x) = t_i(x)/t_i(0)`
  
  Below is the euclidean algorithm in pseudo-code:
  ```
  Initialization: r_(-1)(x) = a(x);   r_0(x) = b(x); 
                  s_(-1)(x) = 1;      s_0(x) = 0
                  t_(-1)(x) = 0;      t_0(x) = 1;
  while(deg(r_i(x)) >= t)
  {
     // compute quotient[q_i(x)] and remainder [r_i(x)]
     q_i(x) = r_(i-2)(x) / r_(i-1)(x)    
     r_i(x) = r_(i-2)(x) % r_(i-1)(x) = r_(i-2)(x) - q_i(x)*r_(i-1)(x)
     s_i(x) = s_(i-2)(x) - q_i(x)*s_(i-1)(x) 
     t_i(x) = t_(i-2)(x) - q_i(x)*t_(i-1)(x) 
  }
  ```

* **Finding the roots of the error locator polynomial using the Chien search**
  The Chien search is an exhaustive search over all the elements in the field.
  Remember that the error locator polynomial is `lambda(x)`.
  So the Chien search goes through all the elements of the `GF(2^m)` field: (`alpha^0` to `alpha^(n-1)`) and if `lambda(alpha^i) == 0` then an error has been located at `(alpha^i)^-1` = `alpha^(n-i)`
  This can be interpreted as an error at location `(n-i)`

* **Determine error values at error locations using Forney's Algorithm**
  Forney's algorithm states that the error values for a Reed-Solomon code are computed by:
  ```
  e_ik = omega(X_k^-1)/derivative[lambda(X_k^-1)] 
  ```
  where `X_k^-1` is a root of `lambda(x) and `i` is the index of the error location.

* **Finally determine the decoded codeword**
  The decoded codeword `dc(x)` is determined with this logic:
  ```
  FOR all codewords indexed by i FROM 0 to n-1
    if(at error location) dc_i = rc_i + e
    else                  dc_i = rc_i
  ```


#### Channel Model:
The codewords `(c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1))` are transmitted over a channel where symbol errors occur independently with probability `Ps`. 
That is each received symbol `rc_i = c_i + e_i`, where `rc_i`, `c_i`, `e_i` are in `GF(2^m)` and
```
                |1-Ps        if a == 0
Prob(e_k = a) = |
                |Ps/(2^m-1)  if a != 0
```

#### Simulation
I determined the performance of the Reed-Solomon codes for two different
choices of code parameters: 
* `m=7, t=60`
* `m=7, t=30`

For each pair of m,t values the simulation outputs a plot of RS encoder/decoder's error rate as a function of the probability of channel error, Ps.
This simulation showed that smaller t-values resulted in a faster rise to an error rate of 1 with increasing Ps values.

## Compiling
This program includes a `Makefile` for use in compiling.
To compile use the Makefile, enter `make`


## Running
To run enter `./build/rs`

Plots are generated using C++'s bindings to `gnuplot`, so you will need to have
that installed.
If on OSX, MacPorts is your friend...
