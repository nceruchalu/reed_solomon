 * gen_gf()
 * Description: 
 *   Generate the Galois field and update representative arrays `alpha_to` and
 *   `index_of`
 *   
 *   ## Background on galois field
 *   - The Galois field consists of a set of elements (numbers). The elements 
 *     are based on a primitive element, denoted `alpha`, and take the values:
 *       0, alpha^0, alpha^1, alpha^2, ..., alpha^(N-1)
 *     to form a set of 2^m elements, where N = 2^m -1. The field is then known
 *     as GF(2^m)
 *  
 *   - In addition to the powers of alpha form, each field element can also be
 *     represented by a polynomial expresion of the form:
 *       a_(m-1)*x^(m-1) + ... + a_1*x + a_0
 *     where the coefficients a_(m-1) to a_0 take the values 0 or 1. Thus we can
 *     describe a field element using the binary number a_(m-1),...,a_1,a_0 and
 *     the 2^m field elements correspond to the 2^m combinations of the m-bit 
 *     number.
 *   
 *   - For example, in the Galois field with 16 elements (known as GF(16), m=4),
 *     the polynomial representation is:
 *       a_3*x^3 + a_2*x^2 + a_1*x^1 + a_0*x^0
 *     with a_3,a_2,a_1,a_0 corresponding to binary numbers 0000 to 1111.
 *
 *
 *   ## Constructing the Galois field
 *   - All non-zero elements of the Galois field can be constructed by using the
 *     fact that the primitive element alpha is a root of the primitive 
 *     polynomial, so that 
 *       p(alpha) = 0
 *   
 *   - Thus for GF(16) with the primitive polynomial [p(x) = x^4 + x + 1] in 
 *     primitives.h, we can say
 *       alpha^4 + alpha + 1 = 0
 *     or
 *       alpha^4 = alpha + 1 (+ and - are the same in a GF; see refernce)
 *   
 *    - Multiplying by alpha at each stahe and using [alpha+1] to substitute for
 *      alpha^4 and adding the resulting terms can be used to obtain the
 *      complete field as shown in the table below:
 *      +------------+---------------------------+-------------+--------------+
 *      | index form | polynomial form           | binary form | decimal form |
 *      +------------+---------------------------+-------------+--------------+

 *      | alpha^0    | 1                         | 0001        | 1            |
 *      | alpha^1    | alpha                     | 0010        | 2            |
 *      | alpha^2    | alpha^2                   | 0100        | 4            |

 *      | alpha^5    | alpha^2 + alpha           | 0110        | 6            |
 *      | alpha^6    | alpha^3 + alpha^2         | 1100        | 12           |
 *      | alpha^7    | alpha^3 + alpha + 1       | 1011        | 11           |
 *      | alpha^8    | alpha^2 + 1               | 0101        | 5            |
 *      | alpha^9    | alpha^3 + alpha           | 1010        | 10           |
 *      | alpha^10   | alpha^2 + alpha + 1       | 0111        | 7            |
 *      | alpha^11   | alpha^3 + alpha^2 + alpha | 1110        | 14           |
 *      | alpha^12   | alpha^3 +alpha^2 +alpha +1| 1111        | 15           |
 *      | alpha^13   | alpha^3 + alpha^2 + 1     | 1101        | 13           |
 *      | alpha^14   | alpha^3 + 1               | 1001        | 9            |
 *      +------------+---------------------------+-------------+--------------+
 *      If we continue this process beyond alpha^14, we see alpha^15 = alpha^0,
 *      alpha^16 = alpha^1,.... so it's a repeating sequence.
 * 
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   alpha_to and index_of arrays have had their memory allocated
 *  
 * Arguments:
 *   None
 *
 * Return:
 *   None
 * 
 * Operation:
 *   - This Galois field is represented by the arrays alpha_to and index_of [See
 *     `reedSolomon.h` for more details]. The goal is to populate the array 
 *     elements with the binary/decimal representation of the polynomial form of
 *     alpha^0 to alpha^(2^m -2). 
 *   - These bounds of 0 to (2^m -2) were chosen because:
 *     + We dont worry about GF element 0; that is always represented as 0
 *     + alpha^(2^m -1) = alpha^0, alpha(2^m) = alpha^1, so at this point it's 
 *       a repeating sequence.
 *   - At the end of it all, it is important to note that for no value i is
 *     alpha^i == 0, so index_of[0] isnt a valid field. Indicate this with -1.

 * gen_prim_poly()
 * Description: 
 *   Generate the primitive polynomial by setting the primitive array, p_x 
 *   [or p(x) really] with an appropriate primitive polynomial of order m.
 *   This info is stored in string form in the array primitive[] (defined in
 *   primitives.h)
 *
 *  ## Background on primitive polynomial
 *  - A Primitive polynomial is a polynomial of degree m which is irreducible. 
 *     It forms part of the process of multiplying two field elements together. 
 *     For a Galois field of a particular size, there is sometimes a choice of
 *     suitable polynomials. Using a different primitive polynomial from that
 *     specified will produce incorrect results.
 *
 *   - As an example, for GF(16), the polynomial [p(x) = x^4 + x + 1] is
 *     irreducible and is thus a suitable primitive polynomial.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - the primitive[] array has the primitive array of order m at index (m-1)
 *   - p(x) has already been allocated the appropriate memory size
 *  
 * Arguments:
 *   None
 *
 * Return:
 *   None
 *
 * Operation:
 *   - Set all coefficients of p(x) to 0.
 *   - read in the primitive polynomial string from primitives.h and update the
 *     non-zero coefficients based on that string.

/*
 * gen_g_poly()
 * Description: 
 *   Create the generator polynomial which is really just
 *   g(x) = (x + a)(x + a^2)...(x+a^2t)
 *   this makes g(x) a polynomial of order 2t (size_g is 2t+1 coz of constant) 
 *
 *   ## Background on (code) generator polynomial
 *   - An (n, k) Reed-Solomon code is constructed by forming the code generator
 *     polynomial g(x), consisting of n-k=2t factors, the roots of which are
 *     consecutive elements of the Galois field. Choosing consecutive elements
 *     ensures that the distance properties of the code are maximised.
 *     Thus the code generator polynomial takes the form:
 *       g(x) = (x - alpha)(x - alpha^2)...(x - alpha^2t)
 *     We are working with mod 2, so - and + are interchangeable:
 *       g(x) = (x + alpha)(x + alpha^2)...(x + alpha^2t)
 *
 *   - This makes g(x) of order 2t:
 *       g(x) = g_0 +  g_1*x + g_2*x^2 + ... + g_(2t-1)*x^(2t-1) + x^2t
 *     so the array representation of g(x) will need to account for 2t coeffs
 *     + 1 constant, so size of g(x) array ,`size_g`, is 2t + 1
 *  
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   g(x) has already been allocated the appropriate memory size of 2t + 1
 *  
 * Arguments:
 *   None
 *
 * Return:
 *   None
 * 
 * Operation:
 *   - clear out g(x)
 *   - Start off with g(x) = (x+alpha)
 *   - Now consecutively multiply g(x) with (x+alpha^i) where i goes from 2 to
 *     2t (Note 2t == size_g-1)
 *     + So g(x) = x*g(x) + B*g(x), where B = alpha^i
 *     + x*g(x) and B*g(x) will be computed separately.
 *     + x*g(x): 
 *       ++ will never have a constant term so set coefficient of x^0 to 0
 *       ++ all other coefficients in g(x) are bumped up to one high power of x
 *     + B*g(x), where B=alpha^i:
 *       ++ All non-zero coefficients in g(x) are multiplied using the fact that
 *          we are multiplying powers of alpha. So each coefficient is converted
 *          to its appropriate alpha^j. The coefficient scaling then becomes:
 *            alpha^[index_of(coefficient)] * alpha^i
 *              == alpha^((index_of(coefficient) + i) % n)
 *     + Finally perform x*g(x) + B*g(x) keeping in mind that addition is binary
 *       XOR

/*
 * get_syndromes()
 * Description:
 *   Get syndrome polynomial from received codeword rc(x)
 *   then set the detect_error flag if s(x) != 0
 *
 *   # Background on calculating syndromes
 *   - As explained in encode(), c(x) is always perfectly divisble by g(x).
 *     Therefore the first step in the decoding process is to divide the
 *     received polynomial by each of the factors (x+ alpha^i) of the generator
 *     polynomial, g(x). This produces a quotient and a remainder that is:
 *       rc(x)/(x + alpha^i) = Q_i(x) + S_i/(x + alpha^i) for 1 <= 1 <= 2t
 *
 *   - The emainders S_i resulting from these divisions are known as syndromes
 *     and can be written as S_1,...,S_2t
 *  
 *   - Rearranging the equation above produces:
 *       S_i = Q_i(x)*(x + alpha^i) + rc(x)
 *
 *   - When x = alpha^i this reduces to:
 *       S_i = rc(alpha^i)
 *           = rc_0 + rc_1*alpha^i + ... + rc_(n-1)*[(alpha^i)^(n-1)]
 *       where the coefficients rc_0,rc_1,...rc_(n-1) are the symbols of the
 *       received code word, rc(x).
 *
 *   - This means that each of the syndrom values can be obtained by 
 *     substituting x = alpha^i in the received polynomial, rc(x), as the
 *     alternative to the division of rc(x) by (x + alpha^i) to form a remainder
 *  
 *   - Substituting in the equation: rc(x) = c(x) + Error(x)
 *       rc(alpha^i) = c(alpha^i) + E(alpha^i)
 *     in which c(alpha^i) = 0 because (x+alpha^i) is a factor of g(x), which
 *     is also a factor of c(x). So:
 *       rc(alpha^i) = E(alpha^i) = Si.
 *
 *   - This means that the syndrome values are only dependent on the error
 *     pattern and are not affected by the data values. Also, when no errors
 *     have occured, all the syndrome values are zero.
 *
 *   - The syndrome polynomial is used by the Euclidean algorithm for finding
 *     the coefficients of the error locator polynomial:
 *       s(x) = S_1 + S_2*x + ... + S_2t*x^(2t-1)
 *     Thus s(x) is of order (2t-1) and so its array representation's size,
 *     `size_s`, must be 2t.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   None
 *
 * Return:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - s(x) has already been allocated memory
 *   - rc(x) is setup
 *
 * Operation:
 *   - Generate all syndrome values for use in populating the syndrome
 *     polynomial, s(x) by looping over 1 <= i <= 2t (== size_s)
 *     + S_i = rc(alpha^i), which is implemented by:
 *       ++ looping over all n terms of rc(x) and converting the decimal
 *          form coefficients into index form GF(2^m) elements.
 *          The variables of these the corresponding terms will be converted to
 *          x^(power of term) == alpha^i*(power of term).
 *          Now that both coefficients and variables are in GF(2^m) index form,
 *          they can be easily multiplied and cummulatively added into S_i.
 *     + sc_(i-1) = S_i, to fit into how we define polynomial array reprs.
 *   - If any syndrome value is non-zero set detect_error to true.

 *
 *   - These roots are found by trial and error in which all possible values of 
 *     the roots (the GF(2^m) values alpha^i, 0 <= i <= n-1) are substituted 
 *     into the error locator polynomial. 
 *
 *   - If the lambda(x) expression evaluates to zero, upon substitution, then
 *     the value of x is a root, and identifies the error position at 
 *     (alpha^i)^-1 = alpha^(n-i).
 *     + This can be interpreted as an error at location (n-i)
